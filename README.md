# World Weather Map

A simple interactive map of the world showing live weather in cities around the world.

## The weather data

The weather data used in this project is from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/current). Their data is collected and processed from different sources such as global and local weather models, statellites, radars and vast network of weather stations.

## To-Do list

Note: This project does *not* showcase a very efficient way of fetching and displaying data. But works well for the small scale of this project.
